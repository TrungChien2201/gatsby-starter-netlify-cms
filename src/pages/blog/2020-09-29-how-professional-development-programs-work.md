Professional development programs -- activities designed to enhance professional acumen or advance a person's career -- are popular among both employees and employers. Many companies value basing hiring decisions on a candidate's overall fit into the corporate culture as well as matching a specific set of needs with skills. The idea is that in the long-term, they would rather invest in a candidate that has the right attitude and compatible personality, even if he or she may not initially have the entire spot-on skill set needed for the role.

But there are also professional development programs that are used to build mandated or government-defined skills into a workforce. For example, teachers may be required to maintain certain credentials, or workers in technical professions may have to stay abreast of the latest industry developments.
